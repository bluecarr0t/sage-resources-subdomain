          "question": "What is a glamping feasibility study?",
          "answer": "A glamping feasibility study evaluates whether a proposed glamping property will be financially viable and operationally successful. It includes market analysis, financial projections, site assessment, and competitive analysis to help investors make informed decisions about their outdoor hospitality investment."
        },
        {
          "question": "How do I find glamping properties near me?",
          "answer": "Use our interactive map to search for glamping properties by location. We have 600+ verified properties across the United States and Canada. You can filter by location, property type, amenities, and price range to find the perfect glamping destination for your outdoor adventure."
        },
        {
          "question": "What's the difference between glamping and camping?",
          "answer": "Glamping (glamorous camping) combines the outdoor experience of camping with the comfort and amenities of a hotel. Unlike traditional camping, glamping accommodations typically include comfortable beds, electricity, heating, and often private bathrooms and kitchens. It offers nature immersion without sacrificing modern conveniences."
        },
        {
          "question": "How much does a glamping feasibility study cost?",
          "answer": "Glamping feasibility studies typically cost between $5,000 and $15,000, depending on the scope, property size, and complexity. Factors include market research depth, financial modeling requirements, and site assessment needs. More comprehensive studies with detailed analysis may cost $20,000 or more."
        },
        {
          "question": "What should I look for in a glamping property?",
          "answer": "Key factors include location and accessibility, unique accommodation types, quality amenities (wifi, bathrooms, kitchen facilities), safety features, and proximity to attractions. Our database includes detailed information on 600+ properties including ratings, amenities, and pricing to help you compare options."
        },
        {
          "question": "Are glamping properties profitable?",
          "answer": "Profitability varies significantly based on location, occupancy rates, pricing strategy, and operational costs. A professional feasibility study can provide market-specific revenue projections and help determine if a property will be profitable in your target market. Many successful glamping properties achieve 60-80% occupancy rates with strong seasonal demand."
