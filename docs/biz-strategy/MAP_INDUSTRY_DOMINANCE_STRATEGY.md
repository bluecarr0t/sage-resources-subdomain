# Map Platform: Industry Dominance Strategy
## Becoming THE Key Data Player in Outdoor Hospitality

**Document Type:** Strategic Business Plan  
**Role:** Chief Business Officer (CBO) Analysis  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Current State:** Interactive map with 500+ glamping properties, population data, national parks  
**Vision:** Establish Sage Outdoor Advisory's map as the definitive industry intelligence platform

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Position
Sage Outdoor Advisory operates a comprehensive interactive map (`/map`) featuring:
- **500+ glamping properties** across US and Canada
- **Population growth data** (2010-2020 census)
- **National parks overlay**
- **Property detail pages** with comprehensive data
- **Filtering capabilities** (country, state, unit type, rate range)
- **Daily OTA Data Pipeline:** Automated database (DigitalOcean) pulling fresh data from Hipcamp and Campspot marketplaces daily—providing real-time rate, availability, and property updates

### Strategic Opportunity
The outdoor hospitality industry lacks a centralized, authoritative data platform. Current solutions are fragmented:
- **OTAs** (Airbnb, Hipcamp) focus on bookings, not market intelligence
- **Industry associations** provide reports but lack interactive tools
- **Real estate platforms** don't specialize in outdoor hospitality
- **Consultants** (like Sage) have proprietary data but don't share it publicly

**Our Advantage:** We have 300+ completed projects, proprietary data, deep industry expertise, and **a daily automated data pipeline from major OTAs (Hipcamp, Campspot)** providing real-time market intelligence. This combination of proprietary expertise and automated data collection creates an unmatched competitive moat. The map is our gateway to becoming the industry's data authority.

### Vision Statement
**"Become the Bloomberg Terminal for outdoor hospitality—the single source of truth for market intelligence, property data, and industry insights that developers, investors, and operators rely on daily."**
