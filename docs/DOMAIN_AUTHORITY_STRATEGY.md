# Domain Authority Strategy: Using Subdomain to Boost Root Domain

## 🎯 Goal
**Improve domain authority of `sageoutdooradvisory.com` by strategically leveraging `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`**

---

## Understanding Domain Authority Transfer

### How Subdomains Help Root Domain Authority

1. **Link Equity Transfer**
   - Quality links to subdomain can indirectly benefit root domain
   - Cross-linking between domains passes authority
   - Google sees them as related entities

2. **Brand Signals**
   - Consistent branding = stronger entity recognition
   - More indexed pages = larger brand footprint
   - More content = more opportunities for backlinks

3. **Topical Authority**
   - Subdomain can target long-tail keywords
   - Root domain focuses on brand/service keywords
   - Combined = comprehensive topic coverage

4. **Backlink Acquisition**
   - Subdomain content is more linkable (resources, guides, tools)
   - Links to subdomain can be redirected/consolidated
   - More linkable assets = more backlink opportunities

---

## 📊 Current State Analysis
