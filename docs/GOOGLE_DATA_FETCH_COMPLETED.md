## 📝 Remaining Properties

**82 properties (8.2%)** still don't have Google Places data. This is expected because:

1. **Not in Google Places Database** - Some properties may not be listed in Google Places
2. **Name/Location Mismatches** - Property names or addresses may not match Google's database
3. **New Properties** - Recently opened properties may not be indexed yet

These properties can be:
- Manually researched and added
