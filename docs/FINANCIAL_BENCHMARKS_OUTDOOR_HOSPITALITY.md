## Appendix: Calculation Formulas

### Key Financial Formulas

**ADR (Average Daily Rate):**
```
ADR = Total Room Revenue ÷ Number of Rooms Sold
```

**Occupancy Rate:**
```
Occupancy Rate = (Rooms Sold ÷ Rooms Available) × 100
```

**RevPAR/RevPAU/RevPAS:**
```
RevPAR = ADR × Occupancy Rate
```

**NOI (Net Operating Income):**
```
NOI = Effective Gross Income - Operating Expenses
```

**NOI Margin:**
```
NOI Margin = (NOI ÷ Total Revenue) × 100
```

**Cap Rate:**
```
Cap Rate = NOI ÷ Property Value
```

**Operating Expense Ratio:**
```
Operating Expense Ratio = (Operating Expenses ÷ Total Revenue) × 100
```

**Revenue Per Site/Unit (Annual):**
```
Annual Revenue = ADR × Occupancy Rate × 365 days
```
