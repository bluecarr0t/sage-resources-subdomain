# SEO Improvements Summary for Sage Outdoor Advisory Subdomain

## 🎯 Quick Answer: How to Rank Higher

**Yes, adding more links from the root domain to the subdomain (and vice versa) is a critical SEO strategy!** Here's what you need to know:

### Why Cross-Linking Matters

1. **Domain Authority Transfer**: Links from the authoritative root domain (`sageoutdooradvisory.com`) pass link equity to the subdomain (`resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`)

2. **Crawlability**: Google needs clear signals about the relationship between domains. Cross-linking helps search engines discover and index subdomain pages.

3. **User Experience**: Strategic linking helps users navigate between related content, improving engagement metrics that Google considers.

4. **Keyword Rankings**: Proper anchor text in cross-links helps both domains rank for target keywords.

## ✅ What's Already Done (Subdomain Side)

Your subdomain already has excellent cross-linking to the root domain:
- ✅ Header logo links to root domain
- ✅ Footer with multiple service links
- ✅ CTA buttons linking to contact pages
- ✅ Contextual in-content links
- ✅ Related Resources section (just added)

## 🚀 What Needs to Be Done (Root Domain Side)

**This is the critical missing piece!** The root domain needs to link back to the subdomain.

### Top 3 Priority Actions:

1. **Add to Footer** (Easiest, High Impact)
   - Add a "Marketing Resources" section in footer
   - Link to key landing pages
   - See: `ROOT_DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`

2. **Add to Navigation** (High Impact)
   - Add "Marketing Resources" or "Landing Pages" to main nav
   - Or create a dropdown menu
   - See: `ROOT_DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`

3. **Create Resources Hub Page** (High Impact)
   - Create `/marketing-resources/` page on root domain
   - Lists all subdomain landing pages
   - Provides clear site structure for SEO
   - See: `ROOT_DOMAIN_IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md`
