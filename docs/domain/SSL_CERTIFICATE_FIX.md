# SSL Certificate Fix for resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com

## 🚨 Root Cause Identified

**Error:** `NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID`  
**Symptom:** Chrome shows "Your connection is not private" warning  
**Certificate Shows:** `*.bluehost.com` (wildcard certificate for Bluehost)  
**Domain Being Accessed:** `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`

### The Problem

The SSL certificate error is happening because **your DNS is pointing to Bluehost instead of Vercel**. 

When you access `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`, the domain resolves to Bluehost's servers, which have a certificate for `*.bluehost.com`. This certificate doesn't match your domain, causing the error.

### The Solution (Keep Bluehost Nameservers)

**✅ You can keep Bluehost nameservers!** Just add a CNAME record in Bluehost pointing to Vercel:

1. Get CNAME target from Vercel (Project Settings → Domains)
2. In Bluehost → Domains → `sageoutdooradvisory.com` → DNS tab
3. Add CNAME record: `resources` → `[Vercel's CNAME target]`
4. Wait 15-30 minutes for DNS propagation
5. SSL certificate will auto-generate on Vercel

**No need to change nameservers!** See detailed steps below.

## ⚡ Quick Fix (If CNAME Already Set Up)

**If you already have:** `CNAME resources → 8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: You DON'T need to enable SSL in Bluehost!**

Since your subdomain points to Vercel via CNAME, **Vercel handles all SSL certificates automatically**. Bluehost is only managing DNS records, not hosting your website. The SSL certificate must be generated by Vercel, not Bluehost.

**Do these steps in order:**

1. **Check for Conflicting A Records** (Most Common Issue)
   - Bluehost → Domains → `sageoutdooradvisory.com` → DNS tab
   - **Delete any A record** with Host Record = `resources`
   - A records conflict with CNAME records

2. **Verify DNS Propagation**
   - Check: [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/#CNAME/resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com)
   - Should show: `8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com` globally
   - If not, wait for propagation (up to 4 hours with your TTL)

3. **Force SSL Regeneration in Vercel**
   - Vercel → Project Settings → Domains
   - Click **"Refresh"** next to `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Wait 15-30 minutes

4. **Clear Caches**
   - Clear browser cache (or use Incognito)
   - Clear DNS cache: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` (Mac) or `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows)

5. **Test Again**
   - Visit: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com` in Incognito mode
   - Should show Vercel's certificate, not Bluehost's

---

## ✅ DNS Propagation Status

**If DNS Checker shows:**
- ✅ **Most locations showing green checkmarks** → DNS is correctly propagated
- ✅ **CNAME resolving to `8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com`** → DNS is correct
- ⚠️ **1-2 locations showing red X** → Normal during propagation, will resolve soon

**Next Steps When DNS is Propagated:**
1. **Force SSL Regeneration in Vercel** (most important)
   - Vercel → Project Settings → Domains
   - Click **"Refresh"** next to `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - This tells Vercel to check DNS again and generate SSL certificate

2. **Wait 15-30 minutes** for SSL certificate generation

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Use Incognito/Private mode to test
   - Or clear cache: Chrome → Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data

4. **Test HTTPS**
   - Visit: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Should show green padlock with Vercel's certificate

## Solution: Configure Domain in Vercel

This is a **Vercel infrastructure issue**, not a code issue. The domain needs to be properly added and verified in Vercel.

### Step 1: Add Domain to Vercel Project

1. **Log into Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Navigate to your project

2. **Go to Project Settings → Domains**
   - Click on your project
   - Go to **Settings** tab
   - Click **Domains** in the left sidebar

3. **Add the Domain**
   - Click **Add Domain** button
   - Enter: `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Click **Add**

4. **Follow DNS Instructions**
   - Vercel will show you DNS configuration instructions
   - You'll need to add a CNAME record in your DNS provider

### Step 2: Configure DNS Records in Bluehost (Keep Bluehost Nameservers)

**✅ You can keep Bluehost nameservers!** You just need to add a CNAME record in Bluehost pointing to Vercel.

**⚠️ DO NOT Enable SSL in Bluehost:**
- You don't need SSL certificates in Bluehost for this subdomain
- Since the CNAME points to Vercel, Vercel handles all SSL automatically
- Bluehost SSL settings are for websites hosted ON Bluehost, not for domains pointing elsewhere
- Enabling SSL in Bluehost could cause conflicts or confusion

#### Get Vercel's CNAME Target First

1. **Go to Vercel → Project Settings → Domains**
2. **Click on `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`**
3. **Copy the CNAME target value** (e.g., `cname.vercel-dns.com` or your project's Vercel URL)
4. **Keep this value handy** - you'll need it in Bluehost

#### Add CNAME Record in Bluehost

1. **Log into Bluehost**
   - Go to [bluehost.com](https://bluehost.com) and sign in
   - Navigate to your account dashboard

2. **Go to Domain Management**
   - Click **"Domains"** in the left sidebar
   - Find and click on **`sageoutdooradvisory.com`**
   - Click on the **"DNS"** tab

3. **Add CNAME Record**
   - Scroll to the **"Manage Advanced DNS Records"** section
   - Click **"+ ADD RECORD"** button
   - Fill in the form:
     - **Type:** Select `CNAME` from dropdown
     - **Host Record:** Enter `resources` (just the subdomain name, not the full domain)
     - **Point To:** Paste the Vercel CNAME target you copied earlier
       - Example: `cname.vercel-dns.com` or `[your-project].vercel.app`
     - **TTL:** Leave as default (usually 14400 or 3600)
   - Click **"Save"** or **"Add Record"**

4. **Remove Conflicting Records (If Any)**
   - If there's an existing **A record** for `resources`, delete it
   - If there's an existing **CNAME record** for `resources` pointing to Bluehost, delete it
   - CNAME records take precedence, so only one should exist

5. **Verify the Record**
   - You should see a new CNAME record in the DNS table:
     - Type: `CNAME`
     - Host Record: `resources`
     - Point To: `[your-vercel-target]`
   - The record should be active

#### Important Notes for Bluehost

- **Keep Bluehost Nameservers:** You don't need to change nameservers - keep them as Bluehost's
- **DNS Propagation:** Changes can take 15-30 minutes (up to 24-48 hours globally)
- **TTL:** Lower TTL values (like 3600) make changes propagate faster
- **Wait Time:** Bluehost may show a note that changes take 24-48 hours, but usually it's faster

#### Verify DNS is Working

1. **Check DNS Propagation**
   - Use [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net) or [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/)
   - Enter: `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Should resolve to Vercel's IP addresses (not Bluehost's)

2. **Command Line Check**
   - Run: `nslookup resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Should show Vercel's servers, not Bluehost

3. **Wait for Vercel to Detect**
   - Once DNS propagates, Vercel will detect the change
   - SSL certificate will auto-generate (takes 5-60 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Domain in Vercel

1. **Check Domain Status**
   - In Vercel → Project Settings → Domains
   - Look for `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Status should show:
     - ✅ **Valid Configuration** (green checkmark)
     - ✅ **SSL Certificate** (should auto-generate)

2. **SSL Certificate Generation**
   - Vercel automatically generates SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
   - This happens automatically once DNS is verified
   - Can take 5-60 minutes after DNS verification

### Step 4: Verify SSL Certificate

1. **Test HTTPS Access**
   - Visit: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Should show green padlock (no security warning)

2. **Check Certificate Details**
   - Click the padlock icon in browser
   - View certificate details
   - Should show: `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`

3. **Use SSL Checker Tools**
   - [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/)
   - [SSL Checker](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html)

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Common Misconception: "Do I Need SSL in Bluehost?"

**Answer: NO!** You don't need to enable SSL in Bluehost for your subdomain.

**Why:**
- Your subdomain (`resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`) points to Vercel via CNAME
- Vercel hosts your website and automatically generates SSL certificates
- Bluehost is only managing DNS records, not hosting your site
- SSL certificates in Bluehost are only for websites hosted ON Bluehost servers

**What You Need:**
- ✅ CNAME record in Bluehost pointing to Vercel (you already have this)
- ✅ Domain added in Vercel (you already have this)
- ✅ Wait for Vercel to auto-generate SSL certificate (5-60 minutes after DNS is correct)

**What You DON'T Need:**
- ❌ SSL certificate in Bluehost
- ❌ SSL settings in Bluehost
- ❌ Any Bluehost hosting configuration

### Issue: Certificate Shows `*.bluehost.com` (Your Current Issue)

**Root Cause:** DNS is pointing to Bluehost instead of Vercel (or conflicting records)

**Solution (Keep Bluehost Nameservers):**

1. **Add CNAME Record in Bluehost**
   - Log into Bluehost → Domains → `sageoutdooradvisory.com` → DNS tab
   - Add CNAME record:
     - Type: `CNAME`
     - Host Record: `resources`
     - Point To: `[Vercel's CNAME target from Project Settings → Domains]`
   - Remove any conflicting A or CNAME records for `resources`

2. **Check Current DNS Configuration**
   - Run: `nslookup resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com` in terminal
   - Or use: [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/)
   - If it resolves to Bluehost IPs, DNS hasn't propagated yet

3. **Wait for DNS Propagation**
   - Can take 15-30 minutes (up to 48 hours globally)
   - Verify with DNS checker tools
   - Should eventually resolve to Vercel's IPs

4. **Verify Certificate After DNS Update**
   - Once DNS points to Vercel, certificate will auto-generate
   - Should show certificate for `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`, not `*.bluehost.com`
   - Click "Refresh" in Vercel if certificate doesn't appear after 1 hour

### Issue: Domain Still Shows as "Invalid Configuration"

**Solutions:**
- Double-check DNS records match exactly what Vercel shows
- Wait longer for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
- Clear DNS cache: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache` (Mac) or `ipconfig /flushdns` (Windows)
- Try accessing from different network/device

### Issue: SSL Certificate Not Generated

**Solutions:**
- Wait 24-48 hours (Vercel auto-generates certificates)
- Check that DNS is fully propagated
- Remove and re-add the domain in Vercel
- Contact Vercel support if still not working after 48 hours

### Issue: CNAME Already Set Up But Certificate Still Shows `*.bluehost.com`

**✅ Your CNAME is correct:** `resources` → `8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com`

**But SSL still shows Bluehost certificate. Here's what to check:**

**Step 1: Verify DNS is Actually Propagated**

1. **Check DNS Resolution**
   - Run in terminal: `nslookup resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Or use: [DNS Checker](https://dnschecker.org/#CNAME/resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com)
   - Should show: `8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com`
   - If it shows Bluehost IPs or different values, DNS hasn't propagated yet

2. **Check for Conflicting A Records**
   - In Bluehost → Domains → `sageoutdooradvisory.com` → DNS tab
   - Look for any **A record** with Host Record = `resources`
   - **Delete any A records for `resources`** - they conflict with CNAME
   - CNAME and A records can't coexist for the same subdomain

3. **Verify CNAME is Active**
   - In Bluehost DNS table, confirm the CNAME record shows:
     - Type: `CNAME`
     - Host Record: `resources`
     - Point To: `8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com`
   - Make sure it's not disabled or deleted

**Step 2: Force SSL Certificate Regeneration in Vercel**

1. **Click "Refresh" in Vercel**
   - Vercel → Project Settings → Domains
   - Find `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Click the **"Refresh"** button
   - Wait 5-15 minutes

2. **If Refresh Doesn't Work, Remove and Re-add**
   - Click **"Edit"** → **"Remove"** the domain
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Click **"Add Domain"** and re-add `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Wait 15-30 minutes for certificate generation

**Step 3: Clear Caches**

1. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
   - Or use Incognito/Private mode

2. **Clear DNS Cache (Your Computer)**
   - Mac: `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache && sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
   - Windows: `ipconfig /flushdns`
   - Linux: `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

3. **Test from Different Network**
   - Try from mobile data or different WiFi
   - Rules out local DNS caching

**Step 4: Wait for Full Propagation**

- DNS changes can take up to 4 hours (your TTL is 4 hours)
- SSL certificate generation takes 5-60 minutes after DNS is correct
- Total time: Could be 1-5 hours from when CNAME was added

### Issue: Certificate Still Shows Wrong Domain (Domain Shows "Valid Configuration" but SSL Error Persists)

**This is your current situation!** The domain is configured correctly, but the SSL certificate hasn't regenerated.

**Immediate Solutions (Try in order):**

1. **Click "Refresh" Button in Vercel**
   - In Vercel → Project Settings → Domains
   - Find `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Click the **"Refresh"** button next to the domain
   - This forces Vercel to re-check and regenerate the SSL certificate
   - Wait 5-15 minutes and test again

2. **Remove and Re-add Domain (Force Certificate Regeneration)**
   - In Vercel → Project Settings → Domains
   - Click **"Edit"** next to `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Click **"Remove"** or delete the domain
   - Wait 2-3 minutes
   - Click **"Add Domain"** and re-add `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - This forces a fresh SSL certificate generation
   - Wait 15-30 minutes for certificate to generate

3. **Check for Old Domain Conflicts**
   - If `marketing.sageoutdooradvisory.com` is still in Vercel domains, it might be causing conflicts
   - Consider removing it (if redirects are working) to ensure clean certificate generation
   - Or ensure both domains are properly configured separately

4. **Clear Browser Cache and Test**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies for the domain
   - Try in Incognito/Private mode
   - Try different browser
   - The certificate might be cached in your browser

5. **Wait for Certificate Propagation**
   - SSL certificates can take up to 24-48 hours to fully propagate globally
   - Even if Vercel shows "Valid Configuration", the certificate might still be propagating
   - Check certificate status: [SSL Checker](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html)

6. **Verify DNS is Correct**
   - Ensure DNS CNAME record points to Vercel's target
   - Check DNS propagation: [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)
   - DNS must be fully propagated before SSL can generate correctly

### Issue: Redirects Not Working

**Check `vercel.json`:**
- Ensure redirects are configured correctly
- The redirect from `marketing` to `resources` should work once both domains are configured

## Current Configuration Status

✅ **Code:** All code references updated to `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`  
✅ **Redirects:** `vercel.json` has redirect from `marketing` to `resources`  
✅ **Vercel Domain:** `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com` is added and shows "Valid Configuration"  
✅ **DNS CNAME:** `resources` → `8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com` (already configured)  
⚠️ **SSL Certificate:** CNAME is correct but certificate still shows `*.bluehost.com` - needs verification and regeneration  

## Quick Checklist

- [x] Added `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com` to Vercel project domains ✅
- [x] Added CNAME DNS record: `resources` → `8646cf04426bb807.vercel-dns-016.com` ✅
- [ ] **Verify no conflicting A records for `resources` in Bluehost** ⚠️
- [ ] **Verify DNS propagated** (check with dnschecker.org)
- [x] Domain shows as "Valid Configuration" in Vercel ✅
- [ ] **Click "Refresh" button in Vercel to force SSL regeneration** ⚠️
- [ ] **Clear browser cache and DNS cache** ⚠️
- [ ] SSL certificate generated (green padlock in browser)
- [ ] HTTPS works: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
- [ ] No security warnings in browser
- [ ] All pages load correctly over HTTPS

## 🚨 Immediate Action Required

**The certificate shows `*.bluehost.com` - your DNS is pointing to Bluehost, not Vercel!**

**✅ Good News:** You can keep Bluehost nameservers - just add a CNAME record!

### Fix Steps (In Order):

1. **Get Vercel's CNAME Target**
   - Go to Vercel → Project Settings → Domains
   - Click on `resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Copy the CNAME target value (e.g., `cname.vercel-dns.com`)

2. **Add CNAME Record in Bluehost**

   - Save the record

3. **Remove Conflicting Records**
   - Delete any existing A record for `resources`
   - Delete any existing CNAME for `resources` pointing to Bluehost

4. **Wait for DNS Propagation (15-30 minutes)**
   - DNS needs to propagate globally
   - Check with: [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net)
   - Verify it's resolving to Vercel, not Bluehost

5. **Vercel Will Auto-Generate SSL Certificate**
   - Once DNS points to Vercel, SSL certificate will auto-generate
   - Takes 5-60 minutes after DNS is correct
   - Click "Refresh" in Vercel if needed

6. **Test in Browser**
   - Clear browser cache or use Incognito mode
   - Visit: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Should show green padlock (Vercel's certificate, not Bluehost's)

**You don't need to change nameservers - just add the CNAME record in Bluehost!**

## Next Steps After SSL is Fixed

1. **Test All Pages:**
   - Homepage: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
   - Map: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com/map`
   - Landing pages: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com/landing/[slug]`
   - Glossary: `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com/glossary`

2. **Update Google Search Console:**

   - Test on multiple browsers/devices

## Important Notes

- **This cannot be fixed in code** - it's a Vercel/DNS configuration issue
- SSL certificates are automatically managed by Vercel
- DNS changes can take time to propagate globally
- Keep `marketing.sageoutdooradvisory.com` configured until redirects are verified

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to enable SSL certificate in Bluehost for the subdomain?

**A: NO!** You don't need SSL in Bluehost at all.

**Explanation:**
- Your subdomain (`resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`) uses a CNAME record pointing to Vercel
- This means Vercel hosts your website, not Bluehost
- Vercel automatically generates and manages SSL certificates for all domains added to your project
- Bluehost is only managing DNS records (the CNAME), not hosting your site
- SSL certificates in Bluehost are only for websites actually hosted ON Bluehost's servers

**What happens:**
1. User visits `https://resources.sageoutdooradvisory.com`
2. DNS (managed by Bluehost) resolves to Vercel's servers
3. Vercel serves your website with Vercel's SSL certificate
4. Bluehost is never involved in serving your website

**You only need:**
- ✅ CNAME record in Bluehost (you already have this)
- ✅ Domain added in Vercel (you already have this)
- ✅ Wait for Vercel to generate SSL (automatic, 5-60 minutes)

### Q: Why is Bluehost's SSL certificate showing (`*.bluehost.com`)?

**A:** This happens when:
- DNS is resolving to Bluehost's servers instead of Vercel's
- There's a conflicting A record pointing to Bluehost
- DNS hasn't fully propagated yet
- The CNAME record isn't working correctly

**Solution:** Check for conflicting A records and verify DNS propagation.

### Q: Can I use Bluehost's SSL certificate instead?

**A:** No, and you don't need to. Vercel automatically provides free SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt. These are:
- Free
- Automatically renewed
- Managed by Vercel
- More reliable than managing certificates manually

### Q: What if I see SSL options in Bluehost?

**A:** Ignore them. Those SSL options are for websites hosted on Bluehost's servers. Since your subdomain points to Vercel, those settings don't apply to your subdomain.
