    definition: "The variation in demand, occupancy, and revenue for outdoor hospitality properties based on seasonal factors like weather, holidays, and tourism patterns.",
    extendedDefinition: `Seasonality refers to predictable patterns of demand variation throughout the year based on seasons, weather, holidays, and tourism cycles. For outdoor hospitality properties, seasonality significantly impacts occupancy rates, pricing, and revenue.

Many outdoor hospitality properties experience strong seasonality. For example, properties in mountain regions may have peak summer and winter seasons but slower spring and fall periods. Beach properties may peak in summer. Properties near national parks may follow park visitation patterns.

Understanding seasonality is critical for financial planning, staffing, marketing, and operations. Sage Outdoor Advisory includes detailed seasonality analysis in our feasibility studies, helping clients understand demand patterns and plan accordingly.`,
