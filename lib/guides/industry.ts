        content: `<p>The RV resort industry continues to grow, despite setbacks following the 2020–2022 Covid-driven boom. As with almost every industry, the outdoor hospitality segment has experienced increases in development costs and a softening in demand, as evidenced by declining revenue per room starting in 2023. This is primarily due to strong inflation, higher interest rates, and greater economic uncertainty impacting consumer confidence in discretionary spending.</p>
        
        <p>The following is Sage Outdoor Advisory's assessment of the state of the RV resort industry. For a comprehensive overview of the broader outdoor hospitality industry trends, see our <a href="https://sageoutdooradvisory.com/blog/2025-outdoor-hospitality-industry-overview/" class="text-[#006b5f] hover:text-[#005a4f] underline">2025 Outdoor Hospitality Industry Overview</a> blog post.</p>
        
        <h3>Tailwinds and Green Lights</h3>
        <p>The biggest tailwind propelling the RV resort industry forward is growing consumer preference. This drives all other factors forward. The following trends are apparent across the entire hospitality industry:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
          <li><strong>Unique Stays:</strong> One-of-a-kind experiences that are authentic and cannot be easily replicated</li>
          <li><strong>Shareable:</strong> Experiences that are highly shareable on social media</li>
          <li><strong>Nature Immersion:</strong> Nature-based stays and experiences like outdoor adventure, recreation, and national parks</li>
          <li><strong>Disconnection:</strong> Escape from the pervasive screens and schedules to reconnect with loved ones, self, and nature</li>
          <li><strong>Wellness:</strong> Growth in demand for hot tubs, saunas, cold plunges, yoga, and massage services</li>
          <li><strong>Localized Experiences:</strong> Stays that connect and tell the story of local towns, history, founders, and nature</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Additional positive factors include:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
          <li>In a higher interest rate and higher construction cost environment, many developers continue to look to the outdoor hospitality space as an option to maintain margins</li>
          <li>Institutional interest from large hotel brands for brand partnerships and outright acquisitions remains consistent</li>
          <li>Institutional investment interest outweighs the small and limited supply of large and multi-site RV resort operations</li>
          <li>According to STR and CBRE hotel reports, the economy and midscale hotel segments have continued to struggle to recover over the last two years, but the upper scale, luxury, and boutique segments have continued to show strong growth and performance. This is consistent in the RV resort market, as the more luxury and upper-scale locations appear to receive robust demand</li>
          <li>Outdoor recreation, state park, and national parks have enjoyed consistent growth. When normalized for Covid rise and fall, it is typically 2-3% over YoY growth over the past decade</li>
          <li>Growing RV ownership and travel continues to drive demand for premium RV accommodations</li>
          <li>Aging population with RV lifestyles and the appeal of long-term stays and snowbird markets provide stable revenue streams</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Headwinds and Roadblocks</h3>
        <p>Despite positive trends, the RV resort industry faces several challenges:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
          <li>As with almost every single industry, outdoor hospitality has seen a softening in demand due to inflation and economic slowdown starting in 2023</li>
          <li>Development costs have increased significantly, with horizontal development over large areas often more expensive than building vertically. Running utility lines, walking paths, and roads across dispersed sites can increase project costs dramatically</li>
          <li>Staffing is often challenging in more remote RV resort locations. On-site staff housing may be a necessity in some locations to address this challenge</li>
          <li>Expect increases in laundry and site turnover service expenses. Many remote properties will be on septic, which will not allow for heavy commercial laundry use on-site. This means outsourcing linens and site turnover expenses can be costly, especially with large drive times for 3rd party services</li>
          <li>International travel is expected to decrease in the near term under the current administration, due to geopolitical tensions rising with major tourism partners such as Canada, Mexico, Europe, and many other countries. This is expected to impact the entire hospitality industry. However, this may be offset by less travel abroad for many Americans</li>
          <li>Government spending cuts to national parks, national forests, and wildland conservation areas may curtail the historically growing outdoor demand, as parks and natural areas experience funding cuts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>At the end of the day, the RV resort industry is like any other investment space. There are distinct advantages as well as disadvantages. Whether a project succeeds and provides strong investment returns depends entirely on the property, the market, and the operator's ability to execute.</p>
        
        <p>The industry serves diverse markets including vacation travelers, long-term residents, and seasonal snowbirds seeking premium RV experiences.</p>`

        content: `<p>The RV resort industry continues to grow, despite setbacks following the 2020–2022 Covid-driven boom. As with almost every industry, the outdoor hospitality segment has experienced increases in development costs and a softening in demand, as evidenced by declining revenue per room starting in 2023. This is primarily due to strong inflation, higher interest rates, and greater economic uncertainty impacting consumer confidence in discretionary spending.</p>

        title: "Market Growth",
        content: `<p>The RV resort market shows both growth opportunities and challenges in the current environment. The biggest tailwind propelling the industry forward is growing consumer preference, which drives all other factors forward.</p>
        
        <p>According to STR and CBRE hotel reports, the economy and midscale hotel segments have continued to struggle to recover over the last two years, but the upper scale, luxury, and boutique segments have continued to show strong growth and performance. This is consistent in the RV resort market, as the more luxury and upper-scale locations appear to receive robust demand.</p>
        
        <p>Outdoor recreation, state parks, and national parks have enjoyed consistent growth. When normalized for Covid rise and fall, it is typically 2-3% over YoY growth over the past decade.</p>
        
        <p>However, the industry has also seen a softening in demand due to inflation and economic slowdown starting in 2023, as evidenced by declining revenue per room. This reflects broader economic challenges affecting discretionary spending.</p>`

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 ml-4">
          <li><strong>Unique Stays:</strong> One-of-a-kind experiences that are authentic and cannot be easily replicated</li>
          <li><strong>Shareable:</strong> Experiences that are highly shareable on social media</li>
          <li><strong>Nature Immersion:</strong> Nature-based stays and experiences like outdoor adventure, recreation, and national parks</li>
          <li><strong>Disconnection:</strong> Escape from the pervasive screens and schedules to reconnect with loved ones, self, and nature</li>
          <li><strong>Wellness:</strong> Growth in demand for hot tubs, saunas, cold plunges, yoga, and massage services</li>
          <li><strong>Localized Experiences:</strong> Stays that connect and tell the story of local towns, history, founders, and nature</li>
          <li><strong>Long-Term Stays:</strong> Growing trend toward extended stays and seasonal residents, particularly in snowbird markets</li>
          <li><strong>Premium Amenities:</strong> RVers increasingly seek enhanced amenities and resort-style experiences</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Institutional interest from large hotel brands for brand partnerships and outright acquisitions remains consistent</li>
          <li>Institutional investment interest outweighs the small and limited supply of large and multi-site RV resort operations</li>
          <li>Development costs have increased significantly, with horizontal development over large areas often more expensive than building vertically</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Operational Trends</h3>

          <li>Development costs have increased significantly, requiring careful financial planning and feasibility analysis</li>
          <li>Horizontal development over large areas is often more expensive than building vertically, impacting project economics</li>
          <li>Market softening starting in 2023 requires realistic revenue projections and conservative underwriting</li>
          <li>Operational challenges, including staffing and infrastructure costs, must be factored into investment models</li>

        <p>At the end of the day, the RV resort industry is like any other investment space. There are distinct advantages as well as disadvantages. Whether a project succeeds and provides strong investment returns depends entirely on the property, the market, and the operator's ability to execute.</p>`
