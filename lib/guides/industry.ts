          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Number of sites impacts land, infrastructure, and development costs</li>

        <p><strong>Validating Your Concept:</strong> A feasibility study helps validate that your RV resort concept is viable in your target market before you commit significant resources.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Securing Financing:</strong> Banks and lenders typically require a feasibility study to assess project viability. A bank-approved feasibility study significantly increases your chances of securing financing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Making Informed Decisions:</strong> Feasibility studies provide data-driven insights about market demand, competitive positioning, revenue potential, and risk factors.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Optimizing Your Project:</strong> Studies identify opportunities to optimize project scope, amenities, and pricing strategies to maximize revenue and profitability.</p>
